This course teaches data analysis, focusing on scientific models: conceptual and causal models. Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence.\n      Lecturers: Prof. Richard McElreath\n    \n  \n  06/01/2023 - 10/03/2023\n\n\n\n  \n    Fundamentals and Applications of Pupillometry\n    University of Padova, Italy\n    \n      This course offers an introduction to the use of pupillometry in cognitive science, combining practical exercises in data processing with free software tools: OpenSesame for implementing classic cognitive psychology tasks and R for analyzing and visualizing continuous pupil diameter changes. Covering key topics such as noise sources, experimental design, data processing options, and the cognitive interpretation of pupillometric measures.\n      Professor: Dr. Giulia Calignano\n    \n  \n  20 hours\n\n\n\n  \n    EEGLAB: analysis of electroencephalographic data\n    University of Padova, Italy\n    \n      The EEGLAB and ERPLAB toolboxes, which operate within MATLAB, facilitate the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. This course offers foundational skills in data analysis and theoretical knowledge through practical examples, covering key topics such as data pre-processing and event-related potential (ERP) computation.\n      Professor: Dr. Mattia Doro\n    \n  \n  20 hours\n\n\n\n  \n    Introduction to R\n    University of Padova, Italy\n    \n      This course introduces the fundamentals of the open-source programming language R, teaching core programming concepts, data structures, and function creation through practical exercises to build versatile skills applicable across academic and professional settings.\n      Professor: Dr. Filippo Gambarota\n    \n  \n  20 hours\n\n\n\n  \n    PsychoPy3: experimental programming\n    University of Padova, Italy\n    \n      This course introduces participants to PsychoPy, an open-source Python-based software for designing and running behavioral science experiments, teaching them how to create, test, deploy, and manage experiments using its flexible and user-friendly graphical interface.\n      Professor: Dr. Thomas Quettier\n    \n  \n  20 hours"
